# I Took My Full Lunch Break Every Day For A Week -- And You Can, Too
###### Step away from the sad desk salad.

I usually eat a hasty lunch at my work desk every day. I voluntarily forgo my midday break -- usually the only opportunity I have to walk around outside and see the sun -- to respond to emails with one hand while gripping a burrito with the other.
I'm not alone. [Sixty-five percent of Americans](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/07/eating-at-your-desk-stress-less-creative_n_3696608.html) eat lunch at a desk or skip the meal altogether, according to a survey. There's mounting scientific evidence that this isn't smart. Not utilizing your proper lunch break -- that is, one spent away from your desk -- actually **decreases productivity and creativity and can hinder your sense of self-worth.** 

And so, I am challenging myself to have lunch away from my desk for one week to see what this simple, yet often overlooked, lunch break business is all about.

Turns out, it's **awesome**.

### Rules ###
1. Have a proper meal away from my desk and laptop [to boost productivity](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/18/lunch-breaks_n_6896004.html).
2. Go for a walk to [reduce stress and improve mood](http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/21/stressed-at-work-try-a-lunchtime-walk/).
3. Visit a  new environment -- [ideally with some green space](https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/sense-and-sensitivity/201404/5-ways-walking-in-nature-benefits-sensitive-people) -- to increase creativity. 
4. Avoid work-talk if possible, as htis is intended to be a break *from* work.

## Predictions ##

While I understood the benefits of taking a break, I thought it might be emotionally difficult to peel myself away from my desk and break the bad habit of sitting there for such long periods of time. I anticipated feeling guilty for leaving my fellow desk-lunch eaters to recharge outside the office. But I also predicted loving the freedom of changing my surroundings.

### Daily Diary ###

#### Day 1, Monday ####

Though I planned to take a mdiday break on the first day of my cnallenge, 3 p.m. came and went before I noticed I hadn't eaten or even gotten up from my desk! Catching up on weekend work had me entirely preoccupied. 

I had just returned from a long holiday weekend, which made it een omre difficult to leave the office for a bit during the day. I felt I neiether wanted nor deserved a break, but its not about what I deserve. It isn't some moreal quandary. It's a lunch break. And so, off I went.
